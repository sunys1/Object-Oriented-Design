Explanation:
	•	A Movie represents a film (e.g., “Inception”, “Avatar”).
	•	A Show represents a specific screening of a movie at a particular time and location (theater/cinema hall).

Relationship Between Movie and Show
	•	One Movie can have multiple Shows, meaning a movie can be screened multiple times in different theaters or at different times.
	•	Each Show is linked to a specific Movie, meaning that a show cannot exist without being associated with a movie.

Example:

Let’s say we have a movie “Inception”. It can have multiple showtimes in different theaters:
	1.	Show 1: “Inception” at 5:00 PM in Theater A
	2.	Show 2: “Inception” at 7:00 PM in Theater B
	3.	Show 3: “Inception” at 9:00 PM in Theater A

Here, “Inception” is the Movie, and each screening (Show 1, Show 2, Show 3) is a Show.
